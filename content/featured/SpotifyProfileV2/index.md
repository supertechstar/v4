A revamped version of my original Spotify Profile project.

✨ Learn how to build this app from the ground up with the [in-depth course I created with newline](https://www.newline.co/courses/build-a-spotify-connected-app/welcome). We cover how to implement **Spotify's OAuth flow** with JavaScript, how to interact with the Spotify API with **axios**, **React hooks**, and **async/await**, how to build a professional, responsive UI with **Styled Components**, how to deploy an app with a React front-end and Express back-end with **Heroku**, and more. ✨
