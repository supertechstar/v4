A revamped version of my original Spotify Profile project.

✨ Learn how to build this app from the ground up with the [in-depth course I created with newline](https://www.newline.co/courses/build-a-spotify-connected-app/welcome). Unlike YouTube tutorials that only explain a few concepts and leave you with half-baked GitHub repos, this course will teach you everything you need to know about how to implement **Spotify's OAuth flow**, how to use **local storage** to store user data, how to fetch data from the Spotify API in a React app with **async/await**, and how to **deploy it to the internet** with Heroku. ✨
